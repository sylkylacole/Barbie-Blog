# Barbie Blog
As a new, yet late enjoyer of the original Barbie movies, I decided to pay tribute to the phenomenal experience I have been having over the past 3 months through creating a Barbie-themed blog website, where I will put real posts about my experience in watching Barbie.

This will update every time I finish a Barbie movie or series, and will contain the already existing entries I have lying dormant in my notes app :)
